# Jacobian Pseudoinverse DSL Inverse Kinematics
A test for Jacobian Inverse Kinematics with damped least sqaure methode, forward kinematics are referenced from 6DOF servo arm

Just run main, and enter coordinate separated by comma and it will show the final angle that converge toward the target position. Don't make your target too far otherwise that shit wont converge.
